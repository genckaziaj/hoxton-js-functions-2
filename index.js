Description
Let's practice extracting data with map, filter. And sprinkle some timer magic, too.

Instructions
- Use this starting template, you'll find the data there => https://codesandbox.io/s/day-6-functions-template-es4eg?file=/data.js
- As always, do not code your solution in CodeSandbox
Using the usual Users and Todo lists:
  - Prompt the user for a letter
  - Find all the users who's name contains the letter 
  - Say hi to those users in the console - but only 1 greeting every 2 seconds.
  - Prompt the user for a user ID. Using the value, find all the todos that are Incomplete and console.log them.

Tips
- Don't forget to clear interval once it's done running
- It's perfectly okay to prompt a user for details while other stuff (i.e.the interval) is running
- Keep your code separated into functions for easier readability later

Challenge
- Prompt the user to enter a property (e.g. 'email' or 'address') and then console.log a list of name - given property. E.g. for email it would look along the lines of: 

Bob Marley - bob@marley.com
Steven Hawking - hawk@this.co.uk
